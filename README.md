## Microservices

> Microservice architecture – a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

See [Server-side Micro-Fullstack](https://github.com/Shyam-Chen/Micro-Fullstack/tree/master/server) for instructions on how to create microservices from source code.
